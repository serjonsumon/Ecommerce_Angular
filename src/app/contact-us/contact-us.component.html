    <h4>Our Story</h4>
    <p>Chaldal.com is an online shop available in Dhaka, Jashore and Chattogram. 
        We believe the time is valuable to our fellow Dhaka residents, and that they should not have to waste hours in traffic, 
        brave harsh weather, and wait in line just to buy necessities like eggs!  This is why we deliver everyday needs to our 
        customers’ door-steps across urban cities. <br>
        Chaldal is a work in progress, and we hope to get better over time. We are 
        firm believers in using technology and education to improve Bangladesh, and we will continue to invest all our effort in 
        pushing the boundaries of technology. <br>
        If you have ideas on how we can improve, we would love to hear from you. Please do email us at infochaldal.com.</p>
    <h4>Waseem (Founder & CEO)</h4>
    <p>Before Chaldal, Waseem worked at Sigfig, a Silicon Valley financial technology startup. At Sigfig, he led the development of 
        a web-based portfolio management software. He designed algorithms to monitor over $100 billion in brokerage assets held by retail 
        investors. He aspires to change the culture in Bangladesh so that people value investment in bold ideas and are more accepting of new 
        technology. Waseem graduated from the Wharton School, the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in Finance and Entrepreneurship.</p>
    <h4>Zia (Founder & COO)</h4>
    <p>Zia brings in experience from the field of management and marketing. Prior to Chaldal, he was the Head of Operations at a ready-made 
        garments factory in Bangladesh. He managed over 1000 employees and oversaw all facets of the business including merchandising, production, 
        commercial design, and marketing. Zia has an autistic brother, and he hopes to provide proper care and education to all autistic children. 
        He also believes that a university degree is no measure of a person’s merit.  Zia holds a BBA in Marketing from North South University.</p>
    <h4>Tejas (Founder & CTO)</h4>
    <p>Tejas is a full-stack engineer. Prior to Chaldal, he worked at Sigfig where he was in charge of tech infrastructure. His hobby includes 
        research on Lisp machines and how we can develop better software. Tejas has a degree in Computer Science from the National University of 
        Singapore. He invites you to read more about Chaldal Engineering.</p>
